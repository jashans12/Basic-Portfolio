                <p>I am currently attending a web development boot camp, which will prepare me to be certified for full-stack web development. 
                     Through the program, I have worked on multiple projects, 
                    which are displayed in the Portfolio tab (listed above).  I currently have eperience with HTML and with CSS.  I am also 
                    currently working on JavaScript, which will be implemented into my assets.  I have the ability to research and learn when I am
                    faced with a problem that is difficult to solve.  This has been the focus of my learning as a whole.
                </p>

                <p>When I'm not working with web development, I enjoy playing and composing music with multiple instruments.  My main instrument is 
                    piano, however I have been learning the guitar, ukulele, mandolin, and tin whistle as well.  I also enjoy playing basketball, 
                    and have become a big Jazz fan.  I like hiking, walking, and running outside.  All of these activities help to refresh my 
                    brain when I am working on projects in web development.
